# Computer-Architecture-Course

This course examines the design of the hardware/software interface through the **Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)**, which defines how a processor is controlled by software. Core topics include implementing this interface by designing a **datapath** to execute arithmetic-logic operations and a **control unit** to orchestrate instruction flow. Advanced concepts focus on exploiting parallelism to boost performance through **pipelining**, managing latency with the **memory hierarchy**, and scaling with **multi-core architectures**.
